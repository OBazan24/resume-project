          Gandalf the White Gandalf is "sent back"[b] as Gandalf the White, and
          returns to life on the mountain top. Gwaihir carries him to
          Lothlórien, where he is healed of his injuries and re-clothed in white
          robes by Galadriel. He travels to Fangorn Forest, where he encounters
          Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas (who are tracking Merry and Pippin). They
          mistake him for Saruman, but he stops their attacks and reveals
          himself.

          Guide Gandalf's role and importance was substantially increased in the
          conception of The Lord of the Rings, and in a letter of 1954, Tolkien
          refers to Gandalf as an "angel incarnate".[T 36] In the same letter
          Tolkien states he was given the form of an old man in order to limit
          his powers on Earth. Both in 1965 and 1971 Tolkien again refers to
          Gandalf as an angelic being.[T 37][T 38] In a 1946 letter, Tolkien
          stated that he thought of Gandalf as an "Odinic wanderer".[T 39] Other
          commentators have similarly compared Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in
          his "Wanderer" guise—an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a
          wide brimmed hat, and a staff,[10][11] or likened him to Merlin of
          Arthurian legend or the Jungian archetype of the "wise old man".
